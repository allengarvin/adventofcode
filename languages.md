Knowledge of language:

1   No experience before

2   Have read a bit about it, or worked with a closely related language

3   Have written a few trivial things in it

4   Worked with in the past, but no extensive experience

5   Multiple years experience

Bash
>Knowledge: 5

>Over 30 years experience with ksh or bash. Terrible language, but it's hard to avoid using.

C
>Knowledge: 4.2

>I loved C in the 80s, but have done my best to avoid it the past 25 years. It's not fun.

CLisp
>Knowledge: 3

>I played with it for fun for a couple years in the 90s

Forth
>Knowledge: 2

>I've never touched Forth before this year, but I dabbled in PostScript for fun in the 90s

Golang
>Knowledge: 1

>I've heard people talk about, but never looked into it. Most annoying thing: references that
>are not used block compilation. It makes it really difficult to comment things out briefly
>when debugging or testing.

Javascript
>Knowledge: 3

>I've tried my hardest to avoid JavaScript all these years. However, since I work with Mongo
>daily at my current job, I've been forced to use it some. Here's a program that creates a
>couple collections in Mongo to help solve the problem.

PHP
>Knowledge: 4

>I worked at a PHP shop for over a decade, though as a systems administrator, not a developer.
>However, during this time I spent a lot of time helping developers debug code, and occasionally
>I would end up fixing bugs and writing short things. Also, I HATE PHP.

Pike
>Knowledge: 5

>This was my primary scripting language for nearly 20 years. I know the creator of the language
>and have done non-trivial, large projects. However, I mostly stopped using it in 2014.

Python
>Knowledge: 5

>My primary language for the past 6 years, mostly used as a systems administration-type language.

R
>Knowledge: 2.5

>I read a book on it and started learning it in 2014, but then I changed jobs and didn't need
>that toolset anymore, so I forgot all about it.

Racket
>Knowledge: 3

>Basically, it's a lisp. Based off Scheme, which I like more than Common Lisp, but it has lots
> of useful libraries. I haven't written any DSLs yet, but hope to for some problem.

Ruby
>Knowledge: 4

>I wrote a lot with it in 2014, when I was looking for a language with better libraries than Pike.
>I love nearly everything about it, but I ended up switching to Python as my main scripting language.

TCL
>Knowledge: 3.5

>I used TCL in the 90s as a sysadmin tool and occasionally to develop X apps via wish, but mostly
>switched to Pike by 2000 or so. It has neat features, and you can write kinda-functional code
>with it, but it also tends to annoy me regularly.
