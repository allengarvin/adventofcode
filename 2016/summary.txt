5     *             *        MD5 hash, doable in either/bitcoin
6     *             *      * most common characters in each column, easy
7     *             *        TLS doable in C or others easy
8     *                      print rectangles and rotate. Tedious, doable
9     *                      string expansion A(1x5)(2x10)--hard in C, moderate in others
10    *                      robots giving high-and-low chips, doable
11    *                      optimizing moving chips on floors, I found this hard but may be missing something
12    *             *        virtual machine, easy in ruby, non-functional in Racket
13    *             *        procedure-generated maze
14    *                      MD5-hash keeping track of things in next 1000 hashes, toughest in C
15    *                      disc at particular times, when they line up--linear algebra problem
16    *             *        binary-transformation, dragon-curve, doable
